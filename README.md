## Challenge Part 2: Authentication Requirement

### Is this a good idea?
The requirement that "This delete user functionality can be done after authentication" is a **bad idea** if not carefully implemented. In the context of `eliminateUser.js`, authentication alone verifies the identity of the user, but it doesn't verify whether the user has the rights to perform the requested action (which is where authorization comes in). Allowing any authenticated user to delete any account can lead to significant security risks, including the possibility of malicious actions where users could delete each other's accounts.

### Authentication vs. Authorization

- **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It ensures that the user is who they claim to be, typically through credentials like a username and password.
  
- **Authorization** is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It ensures that the user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action.

While authentication is necessary to identify users, authorization is crucial to protect resources and ensure that users only perform actions they are permitted to do. Without proper authorization, as highlighted in the `eliminateUser.js` functionality, sensitive operations like deleting users could be abused, leading to compromised system integrity.
